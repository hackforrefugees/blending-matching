# Blending
Blending allows families to connect and share experiences. By matching families that have recently arrived in Sweden with families who have lived here for a long time, we hope to enrich the lives of all involved.

The app is live at: http://blending.herokuapp.com/

The app was created during the Hack for Refugees: http://hackforrefugees.github.io/showcase/
